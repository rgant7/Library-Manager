# Library-Manager

## Description
This project is a multi-threaded library management system designed to handle multiple users borrowing and returning books concurrently. 
It demonstrates the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (Encapsulation, Inheritence, Polymorphism, Abstraction), as well as multi-threading, and Gradle organization.

## Features
- Object-Oriented Programming: The system employs encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- Multi-threading: Allows multiple users to access the library concurrently with synchronization to prevent race conditions.
- Gradle: Allows users to build project easily, test easily, and make dependencies easy to see
